# http-server
HTTP server implementation from scratch

## Description
This project implements a basic HTTP server in C. It serves static files and handles HTTP requests, making it a foundational project for learning how web servers work at a low level. The server is designed to process HTTP GET requests, serve files from a specific directory, and respond with appropriate HTTP status codes.

## Features
- Serves static files such as index.html, images (.png, .jpeg), and other resources from a designated directory.
- Handles HTTP GET requests, parsing headers and determining MIME types.

## Supported Methods
- GET

## TODO
Add support for:
- PUT
- POST
- DELETE
